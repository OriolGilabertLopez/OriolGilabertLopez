### About Me ðŸš€

I'm a **Statistician and Data Scientist** with a strong background in **mathematical statistics**, **machine learning**, and **advanced data analysis**. My work bridges statistical theory and practical implementation, leveraging data to drive informed decisions in real-world settings.

With a BSc in **Applied Statistics** and an MSc in **Data Science & Machine Learning**, I have experience applying both classical and modern modeling techniques to extract value from large, complex datasets. I thrive in environments where rigor meets innovation and where data is used not just for reporting, but for **understanding, prediction, and optimization**.

### Types of Projects I Work On âœ¨

While specific details are confidential, Iâ€™ve been involved in:

- **Customer behavior analysis and segmentation** using clustering and probabilistic models.  
- **Forecasting and anomaly detection** through statistical and machine learning approaches.  
- **Predictive modeling** for business decision-making (e.g., classification, regression, uplift modeling).  
- **Data pipelines and architecture** for real-time processing and reporting in cloud environments.  
- **End-to-end model development**, from EDA to deployment and monitoring.

Many of my public explorations and experiments are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/OriolGilabertLopez) and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/oriolgilabertlpez).

### What Drives Me ðŸŒŸ

Iâ€™m passionate about applying **statistical thinking** to real-world problems. I see data science not just as coding and modeling, but as a way to **ask better questions**, **build structured solutions**, and **learn from uncertainty**. I'm always looking to growâ€”technically and intellectuallyâ€”and love collaborating with others who care about data, rigor, and impact.
